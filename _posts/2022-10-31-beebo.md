The [Polyeffects Beebo](https://www.polyeffects.com/) is many things:
- a multi effects box for synthesizers
- an amp simulation and effects pedal for guitar and bass
- a polyphonic synthesizer
- a modular synthesizer in a box
- a loop station

One thing it is not:
- well documented

That's why I write down here what I found out about its 100+ modules. May it be of use for future me and for other Beebo/Hector users. However,
note that I am not at all competent in what I do here. I won't reveal the inner workings of the ORG Reverb module for the simple reason that
I have no more than the most basic knowledge about effect units. I am also very ignorant about modular systems, so I will probably use some vocabulary
in a wrong way. Anyway, let's start.

This is also not meant to be an introduction to the Beebo. If you are new to this device, read the official manual first.

# General remarks
There are 4 different types of signals which can be routed between input, output and the individual modules like cables beween physical units:
- Audio: a single (i.e. mono) audio stream
- CV: control signals between modules
- Midi: a stream of Midi messages
- Tempo: tempo messages to synchronize modules

## More on CV signals
On physical modular synthesizers, CV (short for _control voltage_) signals are voltages in a defined range (e.g. -5V – +5V or 0V – 10V) and the
modules can use these voltages to communicate with each other. In the Beebo, being fully digital, these voltages are of course only virtual, but I'm
still going to use the unit symbol _V_.

The Beebo usually uses virtual voltages in the range -5V – +5V, but other values are possible.

The CV signals serve a lot of different purposes: they can activate a module, set a parameter of a module, define the amplitude of a sound over
time (i.e. the envelope) and other things. So it makes sense to further divide the CV signals into subtypes. I'm going to prefix the subtype names
with _Cv_, to make it clear if I'm talking about e.g. triggers in a general sense or about a CV signal which is acting as a trigger.

### CvTrigger
(Bild)
A signal at level 0V most of the time with a very short spike to 5V and back. It is used to, well, trigger some behavior in a module. Modules which
receive a _CvTrigger_ (at least the ones I tested) actually seem to to react to all CV signals which get higher than 2V.

### CvGate
(Bild)
A signal at level 0V with a sudden flank up to 5V and back to 0V after some time. Used to activate and then deactivate some behavior in a module. As
with _CvTriggers_, on a receiving module, all signals which cross the boundary of 2V seem to work as _CvGate_.

### CvEnvelope
(Bild)

### CvPitch
(Bild)
Represents a constant or changing pitch over time.
A signal at level 0V usually represents C4 (the middle C), 1V is C5, 2V is C6, -1V is C3, 0.08333V is C♯4 etc.

### CvSetting
Is used to set settings of modules which may vary over time.

Most of the modules have sliders and knobs to configure them. Some of these settings can be controlled not only by manually slide the sliders but also
using a signal. It seems that the range for the signal is always 0V to 5V (for monomodal settings) or -5V to 5V (for bimodal settings), no matter
which range is displayed at the slider. For example: if a slider has a displayed range from 0 to 1 (the most frequent case), feed a value of 4V into
the module to set it to a value of 0.8. That's why there is sometimes a factor of 5 which crops up in my descriptions of the modules.

Keep in mind that when a slider is controlled by a _CvSettings_ input, the displayed value of the slider is ignored. It is also not visible which
slider is currently externally controlled.

This was my made-up distinction of CV subtypes. It is only a logical distinction, not a technical one. Nobody stops you from feeding the triggers
coming from the foot pedal module into the cv/oct input of the Macro Osc module, even though it doesn't make any sense. In my description of the
modules, I'm going to state which type of CV signal is meant to be used, but feel free to disregard it. Maybe you come up with some cool stuff.

## A word about Midi
If you have trouble connecting other gear to the Beebo via Midi, keep in mind that there are two kinds of frequently used Midi TRS connectors, which
are visually indistinguishable. They are, originally enough, called type A and type B. Different batches of the Beebo require different types of these
connectors. BTW, my unit wants type A for input and type B for output. Yay.
According to the [FAQ](https://www.polyeffects.com/faqs), the following types are used (you can find the serial number on a sticker on the back of the Beebo):
- Pink case with serial number ≤ 474 or blue case with serial number ≤ 337: type B for in and out
- Pink case with serial number 475–876 or blue case with serial number 338–936: type A for input, type B for output
- Pink case with serial number ≥ 877 or blue case with serial number ≥ 937: type A for in and out

# The modules
## Audio sources
These modules produce audio triggered by _CvTriggers_ or _CvGates_.

### Macro OSC
**Warning**: the audio output of this module is rather loud when using headphones. Consider routing the audio through a VCA module (Link) with gain
around 0.5.

A monophonic synthesizer with different synthesis engines. Has an internal LPF. Can also produce drum sounds.

When a _CvTrigger_ goes into **Input Trigger**, a short sound (short attack, short decay) is produced. This is useful for drum sounds.

For an instrument sound, insert a _CvGate_ into **Input Level**. This input additionally controls the cutoff of the LPF. (If one of the three drum
sounds is selected, this input controls if the drum sound is accentuated.)

To control the pitch, use either a _CvPitch_ with **Input V/Oct** or **Input Frequency**. For the latter, you have to set **Setting Frequency Mod** to
a value ≠ 0.

In the **Tone** submenu, the sound can be adjusted. The 3 sliders behave different for each of the synth engines. **Timbre** usually
changes the sound from dark and dirty to bright and clean. Harmonics usually introduces dissonances.

The values of the sliders in the **Modulation** submenu are multiplied with the corresponding input signals. So, to modulate e.g. the timbre value,
set **Setting Timbre Mod** to ≠ 0 and feed an LFO into **Input Timbre Cv**.

**Setting LPG Decay** sets the decay of the internal amp envelope, **Setting LPG Color** apparently the cutoff of the internal LPF.

## Gate or trigger sources
### Foot Switch A to E
Foot switch D is triggered if A and B are pressed at the same time. (If D is not assigned, both A and B are triggered in this case.)
E is the same with B and C.

### Drum patterns
Produces three periodic _CvTriggers_, which are meant to trigger a bass drum, a snare and a hihat, respectively. Together, they result in a
most of the time well-sounding drum pattern.

Additionally, there are three outputs which send out _CvTriggers_ if the corresponding drum beat may be accentuated.

The sliders _Bass Drum Density_, _Snare Density_ and _Hihat Density_ control **how often** the respective sound appears from _not at all_ to _on every beat_.

The sliders _Map X_ and _Map Y_ control **when** the three sounds appear. The pattern is deterministic, but not really predictable. Slowly changing
the X and Y values produces smooth transitions between patterns.

The _Chaos_ slider controls the amout of random variation of the _Density_ controls.

A _CvTrigger_ in the **Reset** input resets the pattern, so that it starts on the first beat again.

### Euclidean
The output is up to 4 tracks of _CvTriggers_ which can be used to create a drum pattern.

Each of the 4 tracks has an adjustable number (0–32) of steps. Of these, an adjustable number is _active_, all others are _passive_. Every time a
trigger goes into this module, each track jumps to its next step. If this next step is active, a _CvTrigger_ is emitted (to generate a drum sound.)

You can't precisely configure which steps of a track are active. All you can configure is the number of active steps and an offset. Starting from the
step set by offset, the active steps are evenly (as far as possible) distributed on the track.

If a track arrives on its first step again, a trigger on the corresponding **Is The One** output is emitted, no matter if the first step is active or not.

Use cases:
- if the lengths of the tracks are different (especially if they are coprime), interesting polyrhythms may emerge
- this pattern on the other hand produces a simple house beat: (Bild)

## Other CV sources
### LFO
Produces a periodic CV signal with a certain form. If **Unipolar** is set, the amplitude of the output signal goes from 0V to 5V∙**Level setting**, otherwise,
it has the range ±(5V∙**Level setting**).

There is an unlabeled slider (at least in Firmware 3.20). If you touch it, the Beebo crashes.

### Onset Detect
Produces a _CvGate_ when there is a sudden amplitude raise in the audio input, e.g. a played note.

This module is not simply triggered when the input audio exceeds a certain threshold. Instead, **Onset Threshold** refers to the attack time of the
input audio: the higher the value, the faster the attack needs to be to trigger this module. At the lowest value, the attack still needs to be faster
than ~300ms.

### Cv to Trigger
Produces a _CvTrigger_, when the (arbitrary) CV input exceeds 0.4V. The input must fall to a lower level than that before a trigger can be produced
again.

## Envelopes
Modules which produce _CvEnvelopes_, triggered by _CvTriggers_, _CvGates_ or Audio.

### AD Envelope
The two inputs **Gate** and **Trigger** seem to behave identically, if I'm not mistaking.

A _CvTrigger_ on either input produces on the output a curve which looks like a triangle: linear rise from 0V to 5V for the time set with **Attack Time**, followed by a linear drop back to 0V for the time set with **Decay Time**.

If the input is a _CvGate_, it gets more complicated:
- first a logarithmic raise to 5V (logarithmic means a steep initial curve which gets flatter and flatter so that 5V are theoretically never reached)
- when the gate closes, the attack(!) phase starts by going linearly from the current value up to the final value of 5V in the time set under **Attack Time**
- afterwards, the decay phase starts by going down to 0V as above

### ADSR
Produces your ordinary ADSR envelope out of a _CvGate_. The controls **Sustain Level** and **Trigger Threshold** have the range 0–1, which means
their values must be multiplied with 5V to get the voltages which they represent.

### DAHDSR
Like [ADSR](#adsr), but with an additional delay phase (a certain time from the gate start until the attack phase starts) and an additional hold phase
(a certain time between the attack and the decay phases).

### Env Follower
Produces an ASD curve (looks like a trapezoid), but not triggered by a CV event, but whenever the input audio level exceeds a threshold.

If **Invert** is activated, the output is 5V - (the normal value), or in other words, the output looks like a bathtub.

### Looping Envelope
Can produce either an AD envelope, an AR envelope or function as an LFO. Can do more crazy transitions than linear ones.

The input **Trigger** wants a _CvTrigger_ if in AD or LFO mode and a _CvGate_ if in AR mode. In LFO mode, the input trigger makes the LFO start again
with an upwards slide.

The controls under **Mod** are multiplied with their respective inputs.

## Pitch calculations
These modules do things with _CvPitch_ signals.

### Pitch cal in
A _CvPitch_ in Beebo usually follows the convention that 0V is C4, 1V is C5 etc., also written as _1V/Oct_. If for some reason a module outputs a
_CvPitch_ with a different convention, this module can convert it back to 1V/Oct.

How to calibrate:
1. connect the module to be calibrated (the source module) to this one
2. activate the **Measure** button
3. make the source module play a C4
4. make the source module play a C6
5. deactivate the **Measure** button

From now on, the output of this module is 0V and 1V whenever the source module plays C4 and C5 etc., as it should be.

### Pitch cal out
Similar to [Pitch cal in](#pitch-cal-in), but manually. Basically, this module simply outputs a CV which is **Input** × **Scale** + **Offset**.

### Quantizer
Input is a _CvPitch_, output is the input, but the pitches are quantized to the configured scale.

No idea what the output **Changed** does, in my experiments, the output was always 0V.

This module seems to be a bit buggy, the output is jumpy and doesn't always monotonically increase with increasing input.

## CV Calculations
These modules do calculations with arbitrary CV signals.

### Sum
The output is **Input A** + 5V∙**Setting A** + **Input B** + 5V∙**Setting B**.

This module may be not necessary, because you can add two CV signals simply by connecting two cables to the same input.

### Difference
The output is **Input A** + 5V∙**Setting A** - (**Input B** + 5V∙**Setting B**).

### Max
The output is max(**Input A** + 5V∙**Setting A**, **Input B** + 5V∙**Setting B**).

### Attenuverter
If there are two input signals, the result is **Input A** ∙ **Input B** / 5V, the settings are ignored

If there are no inputs, the output is **Setting A** ∙ **Setting B** ∙ 5V.

If there is an input signal A, the output is **Input A** ∙ **Setting B**, and vice versa.

## Audio effects
These modules do something with audio signals.

### VCA
Simply change the amplitude of the **Input Input** depending on the **Control Gain**, which can also be controlled externally.

Use cases:
- use an LFO to add tremolo to a tone
- generally make the audio softer

### Granular
This is what _I think_ is happening here:
As the audio stream is passing through its play head as usual, a second play head is reading the audio signal from “the past” and _sometimes_ plays a
short snippet (the so called _grain_) of it back. Effects may be applied on this grain. Also, there is feedback involved by (I think) adding the grain
to the next grain.

The slider at the bottom right controls how often the second play head plays a grain. On the center position not at all. Turning the slider to the
left, a grain is played more often and evenly distributed, until it is played virtually all the time, resulting in an almost normal sounding delay.
Turning it further to the left, multiple grains are produced which overlap. The right half of the slider works like the left half, only the grains are
randomly distributed instead of evenly.

Aside from that, a grain is also played if a _CvTrigger_ goes into the **Trigger** input.

The slider at the top right controls the envelope of the grain, resulting in a smoother or harsher overall texture. Fully set to the right, the grains
are somehow smeared.

The _Position_ slider controls the distance between the two play heads, thereby setting the amount of delay from almost 0s to 1s, as far as I can tell.

The _Size_ slider sets the length of the grains from very, very short (resulting in novel sounds) to 0.2s or so, where the input audio is still
recognizable.

The _Pitch_ slider controls a pitch change of the grain (also, it seems to influence the _position_ value). Together with the feedback control, this
results in funny ascending or decending glitchy sounds.

The _Blend_ slider simply controls the dry/wet ratio, that is, the relative volume of the two play heads.

The _Reverb_ control adds a (very strong) reverb, not only on the grain but also on the dry signal.

The _Spread_ slider controls how randomly the grains go to the left or right audio output.

The _Feedback_ slider controls how much a grain is damped before adding it to the next grain. Little dampening results in horrible feedback, so be
careful. Live-controlling this value using the knob on the Beebo can be fun, though.

If the _Reverse_ knob is active, the grains are played in reverse.

Press and hold the _Freeze_ knob to “record” the audio input into a short buffer. Then, the grains are only generated from the audio in this buffer
instead of the input audio stream. The _Position_ slider now controls the position in the buffer used for the grains.

## Pitch shift
Shifts the pitch of the input audio without stretching or compressing it. The audio (dry and wet) is audibly delayed.
